Introduction
The internet has become an integral part of modern life, influencing communication, business, education, and entertainment. The evolution of the web, from its inception to the present, has brought revolutionary changes that have reshaped human interaction and global connectivity. This assignment explores the history of the web, its development stages, and its impact on society.

The Evolution of the Web
The World Wide Web was invented by Tim Berners-Lee in 1989 as a system for sharing information across networks. Since then, it has evolved through different phases:

Web 1.0 (Static Web) – The early web (1990s) consisted of static web pages with minimal interactivity. Websites served as online brochures, providing basic information without user engagement.
Web 2.0 (Interactive Web) – In the early 2000s, the internet became more interactive, allowing users to create and share content. Social media platforms, blogs, and collaborative tools emerged, giving rise to user-generated content.
Web 3.0 (Semantic Web and AI Integration) – The current phase focuses on artificial intelligence, blockchain technology, and the decentralization of data. It enables more personalized experiences, automation, and improved security.
Impact on Society
The web has significantly influenced various aspects of society, including:

Communication: Instant messaging, social media, and video calls have revolutionized global communication.
Education: Online learning platforms and digital libraries have made education more accessible.
Business: E-commerce has transformed traditional shopping, allowing businesses to reach global markets.
Entertainment: Streaming services, online gaming, and digital content creation have changed how people consume media.
